            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our loves unto you and I have received your Letter and newes, for which I give you thanks, and am glad to heare that you are in good health, as I praiſe God we all are. My deſire is to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what paſſages have fallen out in theſe parts. This laſt weeke upon Thurſday the eighth of this month came two Troops of Horſe to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> under the command of my Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> two ſonnes, and upon Saturday the 10. day they had intelligence that the Cavileers in <hi>Oxford</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from thence toward <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they marcht forth towards <hi>Chipingnorton</hi> unto <hi>Chappell</hi> of Heath, which place it was ſuppoſed they would come over. The Country aroſe and went along with them, ſo that they were (as I ſuppoſe) ſix hundred ſtrong, where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued moſt part of the day; but the Cavalleers having warning of us came not, onely we tooke eight of them that were ſent out for ſcouts, and our ſcouts diſcovered the reſt, which retreated backe againe toward <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the ſight of
<pb facs="tcp:156088:2"/>them; ſo the day being far ſpent we returned all home, and the Troops unto their quarter to <hi>Banbury,</hi> which the Cavalleeres having notice of they came on along that way, and came to <hi>Stow</hi> five miles from <hi>Chipping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norton</hi> on ſaturday night about twelve a clock, where they were ſomewhat reſiſted by the watch, which kild one of their Horſes, and hurt ſome more, but being not able to withſtand them they were forced to give them entrance, when they preſently diſarmd the Town, and tooke away twelve Muſquets, and a load of Armour that the ſaid <hi>Stow</hi> men had taken the day before belonging as is ſuppoſed to Sir <hi>Willam Walter</hi> a great delinquent in our County, living neere to <hi>Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingnorton,</hi> who was alſo taken the ſame day at <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> neere <hi>Eſum,</hi> and kept at one Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> houſe in that Towne, whether the Cavalleers preſently marcht, and it being but a Countrey-towne could not reſiſt them, ſo they came and beſet the houſe, there being not above ſix men in the houſe, which ſhot at them, and killed (as is credibly reported) 4. of them, one of whom was a French-man, and a chiefe Commander. Sir <hi>William Walter</hi> being in an upper Chamber broke a barre out of the Window and leapt downe, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped; whereupon the Cavalleers retreated, and they that were in the houſe had time for to come forth, but they came back a gaine and plundred the houſe, and tooke away all the money and plate, and the beſt goods they could find, and five Horſes, and loaded it into a Cart to carry it away; but finding that they could not make ſo much ſpeed as they deſired with the Cart, left it about two miles from the Towne and tooke the Horſes and the beſt of the goods that they
<pb facs="tcp:156088:3"/>could carry on Horſebacke and went to <hi>Perſhow,</hi> where they buried the Frenchman that was ſlain at <hi>Broadway,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Saltwich,</hi> where we heare they ſtill remaine. The news of their comming to <hi>Stow &amp; Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> was brought to <hi>Banbury</hi> upon Sunday by one of the clocke in the afternoone, and the Trumpet foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded preſently for the 2. Troops of Horſe to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſently to purſue them; they ſet forth from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> about 3. of the clocke, great ſtore of the Towne going with them, and the Country joyned with them ſtill as they went along: they marcht to <hi>Cambden</hi> that night, where they came about 12. of the clocke, and ſtayed there about 2. houres, whilſt their Horſes bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then went forward untill they came to <hi>Eſum</hi> which is 28. miles from <hi>Banbury.</hi> The Country came in all the way they went, ſo that it was ſuppoſed they were 1000. ſtrong They ſtill went forward 5. mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Eſum,</hi> and then they had notice that they were all gone to the Town of <hi>Wich,</hi> and that it was not ſafe following them any further, for the Town vvas for the Cavalleers, and that they had Ordnance in it, and the Country beyond it vvas wholly for the King; beſides it vvas Woodland-ground and full of dangerous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that it was doubtfull they might be ſet upon out of the Woods before they came there; ſo they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe againe without doing any thing. The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers that fled to <hi>Killingworth</hi> Caſtle, when they were driven from before <hi>Coventrey</hi> came forth upon mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, and the Towne of <hi>Coventrey</hi> hearing of them ſet upon them, where they had a hot skirmiſh for the time, and ſome men ſlain on both ſides, but the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers fled, and the City of <hi>Coventry</hi> have taken the
<pb facs="tcp:156088:3"/>Caſtle, and the Ammunition in it. This day Collonell <hi>Browne</hi> with 500. Dragoneres came to <hi>Banbury,</hi> and the 2. Troopes of Horſe went forth. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and the truth of what hath paſſed here this laſt weeke: ſo I reſt</p>
